# COOP DataLab

## What is the COOP DataLab? 

The COOP DataLab is a curated, open source, data analytics laboratory complete with: 
- A relational database and a UI tool to manage it  
- A Python environment with the most common data analytics tools pre-installed 
- And a data visualization tool to work with the data 

Data is preloaded into the database so that students can start exploring right away. However, there is also an easy and flexible ETL process that will allow students to easily add their own data to the database using a configuration file (minimal coding required.) 

Additionally, students can extend this environment to include other technologies as well (e.g. students who want to practice working with real-time frameworks can easily add a Kafka broker to the environment.) Just as well, students can use as much or as few of the included resources and still practice real-world data analytics skills.

Finally, the COOP DataLab can run on just about any operating system. This means that students can use these tools without worrying about compatibility.

## Why was this built?

It was built to provide an environment that resembles a real-world data analytics stack without having to worry much about configuration and setting up resources on the cloud or on a local machine. It’s meant to have students working within a production-like environment within minutes. With access to this kind of environment, students can understand the entire data analysis process from end-to-end using tools that will make them job-ready. 

## How does it work?

COOP DataLab relies on Docker, an open source containerization program, to run the included technologies on just about any operating system. Once Docker is installed and running on a student’s workstation, starting the lab is as simple as running the initialization script. From there, students can begin using the technologies through both the command line and their local browser (but mostly their browser.)
